GUI stands for graphical user interface. It simply allows users to interact with devices through 
graphic elements. These elements can include things like icons, cursors, menus, buttons, etc. Using 
these components lets the user interact with computers or other devices without having to know 
specific commands as the action is simply laid out. It also helps with more consistancy and 
accessibility across interfaces. 
CLI stands for command line interface. This tool interacts with devices through typed commands. It 
uses a shell which gives acces to the operating system. The shell will interpret the command typed by
the user, finds the command on the systems path, and executes it. After that process is completed,
the system will send out feedback to the CLI. A big perk of this interface is that it enables command
history so the user can easily recall orevious inputs.
