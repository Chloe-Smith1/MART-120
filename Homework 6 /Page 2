    <h2><font color="white">"May I Carry Your Basket?"</font></h2>

  <p> <font color="white">Sam Lewis spent the evening playing chess at his friend's
    house.</p>
  <p>It was about midnight when they finished their game, and he started home.</p> 
  <p>Outside it was icy cold and
as quiet as the grave.</p>
 
  <p>As he came around a turn in the road, he was surprised to see a woman walking ahead of him.</p>
  <p>She was carrying a basket covered with a white cloth.</p>
  <p>When he caught up to her, he looked to see who it was.</p>
<p>But she was so bundled up against the cold, it was hard to see her face.</p>
<p>"Good evening," Sam said. "What brings you out so late?"</p>
<p>But she didn't answer.</p>
<p>Then he said, "MayI carry your basket?"</p>
<p>She handed it to him.</p>
<p> From under the cloth, a small
voice said, "That's very nice of you," and that was followed by wild laughter.</p>
<p>Sam was so startled that he dropped the basket—and out rolled a woman's head.</p>
<p>He looked at the head, and he stared at the woman.</p>
<p>"It's her head!" he cried.</p>
<p>And he started to run, and the woman and her head began to chase him.</p>
<p>Soon the head caught up to him.</p>
<p>It bounded into the air and sunk its teeth into his left leg.</p>
<p>Sam screamed with pain and ran faster.</p>
<p>But the womanand her head stayed right behind.</p>
<p>Soon the head leaped into the air again and bit into his other leg.</p>
<p>Then they were gone.</p> </font>
