I've taken so many learning style quizes over the years and I almost always get a different answer 
every time. With the one that was linked, the results were:
Audio: 40%
Tactile 20%
Visual: 40% 
I would agree that tactile should be the lowest style. I've never cared about having a physical
interaction element when it comes to learning. Unless it's something that is absolutely required, I 
personally feel like it just takes too much time to get to the point when I could have just read about
it on my own. I also don't personally view myself as being an auditory learner, I wouldn't say I do any
of the common things listed on that website. I definetly don't sit and read things outloud or ever 
record myself. I think a big reason why I now prefer doing universitty work online is because I can 
take the information that is presented to me and study it in a way that I believe works best for me. 
Students aren't really given that ability when it comes to high school, everything is structured in such
a specific way. I always had a harder time sitting through lectures in person because I would get
distracted or fall behind if the teacher/professor was talking too fast. That's not something I have to
worry about now. If I have a lecture posted that I'm supposed to listen to, I will transcribe it so I 
can take notes at my own pace and make sure I'm not missing any information.
